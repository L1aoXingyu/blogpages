I am currently working on LLM at Lightyear.ai. Prior to this, I was at [HX](https://www.rhino.auto/), where I was responsible for the training and deployment of BEV perception algorithms for autonomous driving. Even before that, I was engaged in work related to the [LiBai](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/libai) distributed large model training framework at [OneFlow](https://oneflow.org/index.html). Going further back, I was involved in ReID-related algorithms and research at JD AI Research, and I developed [FastReID](https://github.com/JDAI-CV/fast-reid) toolbox.

My career has been focused on various aspects of AI and machine learning, from research to practical application in autonomous driving and large model training. Currently, I'm bringing this experience to my work at Lightyear.
